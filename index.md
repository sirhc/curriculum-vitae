# Personal Projects

## [Home Directory Configuration](https://github.com/sirhc/dotfiles)

Mostly used as a way to keep all of my configuration safe and in one place, I
use this as a showcase of the tools I use to be productive.

## [Vim Profile](https://github.com/sirhc/vim-profile)

I have used Vim for many years and have collected my configuration here, which
I use to help others learn about Vim's features.

## [Home Lab](https://github.com/sirhc/homelab)

A trend among technologists is to self-host services that do not rely on any
one company or cloud provider. I have started with Grafana and a few data
collectors. Eventually, I will replace most of the cloud services I use with
self-hosted applications.
